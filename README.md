Avionics

This repository is intented to recreate simulation of functionality of avionics glasscockpit.
It's intend just for learning and not to apply in real life Technologies.




Input signals:

Engine RPM (Rotation Per Minute): Measure the rotation speed of the turbofan's engine and display it as a dynamic RPM gauge on the display. You can use a needle or a digital readout to represent the RPM value.
Thrust Level: Display the current thrust level of the engine. You can show it as a percentage or use a graphical representation like a bar graph to indicate the thrust setting.
Fuel Consumption: Show the real-time fuel consumption rate of the engine. You can display it as fuel flow rate or as the remaining fuel in the tank.
Temperature: Display the temperature of different engine components, such as turbine inlet temperature, exhaust gas temperature, and intercooler temperature.
Engine Health Parameters: Monitor engine health parameters like vibration levels, bearing temperatures, and other critical indicators. Display these values in a dashboard to provide quick insights into the engine's health status.
Air Pressure: Monitor and display the air pressure at various stages of the engine, such as compressor inlet pressure and turbine exhaust pressure.
Air-Fuel Ratio: Display the air-fuel ratio to ensure proper combustion and engine efficiency.
Engine Status and Warnings: Use visual indicators to display engine status and any warning messages related to the engine's performance or health.
Altitude and Speed: Combine engine data with other flight data like altitude and airspeed to provide a comprehensive view of the aircraft's performance.
Vibration Analysis: Analyze the engine's vibration data and display it as a spectral analysis or vibration waveform to detect any abnormal behavior.
Power Lever Position: Display the position of the power levers to provide information on the engine's power setting.
Compressor and Turbine RPM: Show the rotation speed of the compressor and turbine separately to monitor their performance.
Engine Efficiency: Calculate and display the engine's efficiency metrics, such as specific fuel consumption or overall efficiency.
Warnings and Alerts: Implement a system that displays alerts and warnings for critical events, such as exceeding certain temperature limits or low oil pressure.
Historical Data Visualization: Save and visualize historical engine data to detect trends and patterns over time, aiding in predictive maintenance.
